## üìÑ User Stories

- ### Create Bill
    As a user,
    Given I provide a merchant, date, amount, and upload an image,
    When I submit,
    Then a bill is created with a single linked image, and I see it in the list.

- ### Edit Bill

    As a user,
    Given an existing bill,
    When I update the merchant, date, amount, or categories,
    Then the changes persist and are visible on reload.

- ### Categories

    As a user,
    Given categories exist,
    When I assign multiple categories to a bill,
    Then the bill shows all assigned categories.

- ### Reminder

    As a user,
    Given a bill or product with related information (e.g., warranty or service history),
    When the system detects that:

    The warranty will expire within a set period (e.g., 2 weeks), or

    The user hasn‚Äôt performed a service in a set period (e.g., 2 months),
    Then a reminder is automatically created and shown under the related bill or product.
    And these reminders also appear in a ‚ÄúDue Soon‚Äù list showing upcoming or overdue items.
    And after a reminder‚Äôs time or event has passed, the user can manually delete it (or the system can automatically clear expired reminders).

- ### Search / Filter

    As a user,
    Given many bills,
    When I filter by category, merchant, date_from/date_to, or amount_min/amount_max,
    Then results include only matching bills.

- ### Single Image Constraint

    As a user,
    When I try to upload a second image for the same bill,
    Then the first image is replaced.
